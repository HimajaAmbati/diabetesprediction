This project is a foundational exercise to practice the basics of machine learning. The steps I followed are outlined below:
1. **Data Loading:** I started by loading the dataset, which is in CSV format, into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Using various built-in functions, I explored and understood the different input health metrics such as glucose, blood pressure, insulin levels, etc.

3. **Data Standardization:** To ensure all input features are on the same scale, I standardized the data using `StandardScaler`.

4. **Data Splitting:** I split the dataset into training and test sets, with the test set comprising 20% of the total data.

5. **Model Training:** I trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using the training data.

6. **Model Evaluation:** I evaluated the model's performance by checking the accuracy score on both the training and test data.

7. **Prediction:** Finally, I used the trained model to predict the outcome for new input data.

This structured approach allowed me to practice essential machine learning techniques and gain insights into how each step impacts the model's performance.
